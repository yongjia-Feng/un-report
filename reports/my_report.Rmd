Exercise : R Markdown syntax
*create a bullet point list with three items
*as the 1st item, write the name of your currently favorite programming language in bold
*as the second item, write the name of  a function you hVE SO FAR FOUND MOST UEFUL IN LITALICS
*as the 3rd item, write one thing you want to learn next on your programming journey in bold italics
*turn your bullet point list into a numbered list
*create a 4th list item and find an online guide and /or cheat sheet for basic markdown syntax, write its name down here and hyperlink its url

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
